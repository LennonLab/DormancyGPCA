# DormancyGPCA
Resolving the Great Plate Count Anomaly 

## Goal
Microorganisms that engage in dormancy become members of a seed bank, a reservoir of genetic diversity, of which resuscitation from will be a critical solution to resolving the GPCA. This experiment represents a step in understanding how cell-cell signaling pathways can be used to study microbial seed bank and begin to resolve the GPCA.
